# scratchClient-Tutorials

ScratchClient is a program that connects Scratch with external components, like LEDs, buttons, etc.
This repository holds a set of scripts that make it easier to setup and work with scratchClient, and a set of tutorials on how to do so.

This material is under development for Raspberry Pi. The goal is to later run it with Windows as well.

So far, there are pre-releases only. The intent is that everything used in the Pi and More 10 1/2 conference in Stuttgart on 24 Feb will be ready for download by 21st March 2018. (unfortunately, the earlier expectation of March 7 could not be achieved - if the shift causes issues then please let me know - email address on the handout of Stuttgart).
